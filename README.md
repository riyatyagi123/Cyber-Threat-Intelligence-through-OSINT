# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-through-OSINT

VigilantOSINT is a cybersecurity platform that integrates multiple open-source intelligence (OSINT) services into a single, easy-to-use dashboard. The platform allows users to scan files and URLs, investigate IPs and domains, and stay updated with the latest cybersecurity news.

By consolidating intelligence feeds such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, Pulsedive, WhoisXML, GreyNoise, IPInfo, and IPRegistry, the system reduces the need for switching between multiple tools. It provides structured results, automated reporting, and a responsive interface designed to support faster and more accurate threat investigations.
