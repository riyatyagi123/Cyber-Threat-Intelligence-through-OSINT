# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-through-OSINT

VigilantOSINT is a cybersecurity platform that combines machine learning with open-source intelligence (OSINT) to detect, analyze, and report threats in real time.

The system brings together multiple intelligence APIs such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, Pulsedive, WhoisXML, GreyNoise, IPInfo, and IPRegistry, while also integrating a machine learningâ€“based malicious URL detection model. The goal is to reduce investigation time, automate correlation of threat indicators, and provide meaningful, structured reports to security analysts.
